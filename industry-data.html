			<h3> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h3> <br><br>

			<h3><i> Jesse Corlet </i></h3> <br><br>
			<p> The Burning Glass data was very informative in general, but it did not present much data relating to my ideal job,
				although I found it interesting that skills like SQL and Java Script are some of the most in-demand skills.
				I assumed that these skills were so popular that the demand would be diluted by the number of people that possess
				these skills. Regardless my interest in machine learning doesn’t come from demand in the workplace, so my opinion
				on the ideal job has not changed. </p><br><br>

			<h3><i> Sam Keartland </i></h3> <br><br>
				<p> I found the data quite useless for myself as I already know I want to do full stack development/software engineering,
					and both are in relatively high demand. I am also fully aware that communication plays a huge role in any IT
					position, or any job for that matter. It was nice seeing the most in-demand programming languages ranked though. </p><br><br>

			<h3> <i> Michael Pattie </i></h3> <br><br>
				<p> Looking at the burning glass data my ideal job idea hasn’t changed, the skills in demand are those required
					to be Cloud engineer/solutions architect. As expected, it is an extremely in demand job with coding at
					the top of the list of desirable skills. Due to the way in which the IT industry is heading I still
					believe this to be a great area to pursue. </p><br><br>

			<h3><i> Alana Spicer </i></h3> <br><br>
				<p> Based on Jesse Corlet research on industry data research and having looked at burning glass my opinion of my ideal
					job has not changed. Although I think I am not creative enough I am sure this can come with practice in the industry
					. I feel the same as Jesse, my interest in graphic design does not come from the demand in the workplace
					it comes with interest in the field of work. Some financial benefit also interests me also. </p><br><br>

			<h3><i> Samantha Watts </i></h3> <br><br>
				<p> Based on the information I have reviewed from the Burning Glass Data my interest and opinions of my ideal job
					has remained unchanged.  I am always prepared to tackle new ideas and give projects 110 per cent so I found it
					very exciting and interesting to see that SQL and Java (two areas I am interested in exploring) are among the
					most in-demand skills.  It was interesting that even in today’s environment independent work is of such less
					importance than teamwork or even time management as I would have expected that working independently and
					having exceptional time management skills would have been more evenly distributed in demand.
					There is always a demand for software engineers, therefore my career path preference is unchanged. </p><br><br><hr><br><br>
