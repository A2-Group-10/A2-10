						<p>I have a dual citizenship with Australia and South Africa. I have completed a Diploma in Screen and Media in my high school years. I have many interests; I enjoy playing poker and have an avid love of rap music. I love how Information Technology covers a wide range of topics like machine learning to predict financial markets, true Artificial Intelligence, and advancements in robotics. The thing that excites me most is that there are many fields in IT that are still being developed. Hence why my interest sparked in IT, I think that IT will be able to support me remotely when necessary.</p>

						<p><i>Myer–Briggs Test – Assertive Logician</i></p>

					  <p>My results described me well but should be taken with a grain of salt. I relate to having trouble executing my ideas and I can be indecisive with important decision making.</p>

						<p><i>Learning Style Preference Test – Strong Kinaesthetic</i></p>

						<p>I prefer practical examples, trial and error and case studies. I also like learning about things that I can experience and learn effectively. I know that when I learn, I learn best by explaining concepts out loud or to others, teaching in a roundabout way.</p>

						<p><i>Big Five Personality Test – Ocean (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)</i></p>

						<p>My results have shown me that I may have a difficulty when working with a team. My indecisiveness is what I feel lets me and possibly my team down. I leave projects till the last minute before sharing. When working in a group I will have to consider all my other team members; this will be a new challenge for me. I will benefit from a team which has a decisive leader. I love working alone but will have to give this up and give up control of projects when working as a team and not as an individual. I will overcome this eventually.</p>
