				<h2><i> Samantha Watts </i></h2><br>
					<h3> Student number: s3935798 </h3>
						<p>I am superpower who has a chaotic family life,
						and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
						To maintain my chaos, I love calm. 
						My love of martial arts is a sport
						I am wishing to uptake sometime soon and find the time to get back into this sport I love. 
						I want to up-skill and so a career that I am passionate about. Information Technology has limitless possibilities.
						If there is a need there is a possibility for a solution. My background is in health and tourism, I hope studying IT will add depth to my scope in my career. </p><br>
						
						<p><i>Myer-Briggs test – Advocate personality type</i><br></p> 
							<p>I am a peacekeeper and a great team player. I enjoy working in teams where cooperation and independence are equally valuable.
								I will always try to go the extra mile, with this comes burn out and I consider a weakness of mine sensitive to criticism and being a perfectionist.
							Therefore, I see this as a downfall as there will be other team members that I will have to work with that will the same attributes as my weaknesses. </p><br>
							
						<p><i>Learning Style Test – Auditory/ Tactile Learner </i><br></p> 
							<p>I learn by hearing and doing. Please don’t show me slide after slide, boring!!!
							   Even though I find this a great way to learn for me especially in class situations and lectures I know that I do need regular breaks while I study.
							I am a great listener and I feel that listening to the needs of others and implementing ideas will be beneficial for our group. </p><br>
							
						<p><i>Testcolour – Extrovert. Introvert </i><br></p>
							<p>My personality qualities indicate that I am creative, imaginative, tuned with emotions and needs to others.
							   I communicate my knowledge well to others. I set action plans to achieve my set goals.
							My personality features will blend well within a group environment to reach our combined academic goals. </p><br>

							<img src="mike-pat.jpg" alt="mike"  style="width:250px;Height:300px">
					
					<h3> Student number: s3930699   </h3>
						<p> I am a British born adopted Australian who loves live down under.
						    I am an Electrician by trade and pretty much just wanted a career change away from construction sites and buildings.
							I love to build PCs. When I was a youngen I remember thinking that it was impossible that somebody can create such a beautiful digital landscape in which I can play in.
							My interest in IT stemmed from there. I am a great problem solver so my love of fixing computers or phones for friends and family grew out of satisfaction.
							I am an IT support analyst, so whilst I do have experience in the IT world, I would like to consolidate my knowledge and learn a lot of new things. </p><br>
							
						<p><i> Myer-Briggs Test- Assertive Entrepreneur </i><br></p>
							<p> I am full of passion and energy. I can tend to get caught in the moment. 
							    I can be risk prone and impatient and just want to get things done. I like to think on my feet and can make quick decisions.
							I like to be in control and steer my own ship, as the saying goes.  </p><br>
						
						<p><i>Learning Style Test – EMTRAIN </i><br></p>
							<p> I am mostly a Pragmatist which means that I need to see things and put my learning into practice.
								I like to try out new ideas and theories to see if they work or not. 
							Reflector and Theorist style received that same percentage which I found interesting in that whilst I do like to stand back and observe I also like to think things through in a logical manner. </p>
							
						<p><i>Creativity Test – score was 59.79 typical is 62.92 </i><br></p>
							<p> I am a practical and creative person and I like to make my own bold decisions and put them into practice in ways that others would not dream of, hence this is where my creativity comes into play.  
								I can be dismissive of other people’s ideas something in which I will have to learn to combat when working in a group. 
								I do like to push boundaries with regards to new ideas others may not be comfortable with. I will listen carefully when conflict arises and consider other people’s ideas.
							I will try and see other perspectives in a patient manner. I will show respect for rules and only pursue ideas in the scope of the task. </p><br>

							<img src="jesse.jpg" alt="jesse"  style="width:250px;Height:300px">
					<h3> Student number: s2931356  </h3>
							<p> I have a dual citizenship with Australia and South Africa.
							I have also completed a Diploma in Screen and Media in my later high school years.
							I have many interests to list, but I enjoy playing poker and have an avid love of rap music.
							I love how Information Technology covers a wide range of topics like machine learning to predict such markets as financial, true Artificial Intelligence and advancements in robotics.
							The thing that excites me the most is that there are many fields in IT that are still being developed. For this strange covid world we live in,
							hence my interest sparked in IT that is able to support me remotely when necessary.  </p><br>
							
					<p><i> Myer-Briggs Test- Assertive Logician </i><br></p>
						<p>My results described me well but should be taken with a grain of salt. I relate to having trouble executing my ideas and I can be indecisive with important decision making. </p><br>
						
					<p><i>Learning Style Preference Test – Strong Kinaesthetic </i><br></p>
						<p> I prefer practical examples, trial and error and case studies, things that I can experience to learn effectively. I know that when I learn best is explaining concepts out loud or to others, teaching in a roundabout way.</p><br>
						
					<p><i>Big Five Personality Test – Ocean (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) </i><br></p>
						<p>All of my results have shown me is that I may have a difficulty when working with a team is my indecisiveness.
							I leave projects till the last minute before sharing. I will have to consider all my other team members;
							this will be a new challenge for me. I will benefit from a team with a decisive leader.
						I love working alone but will have to give this up and give up control of projects when working as a team and not individual. I will overcome this eventually. </p><br>
						
				<h2><i>Sam Keartland  </i></h2><br>
					<img src="samk.png" alt="sam-k" style="width:220px;height:320px">
					
				<h3> Student number: s3568995   </h3>
					<p>  I am an avid lover of anything computers and making my life easier whilst exploring and playing in the IT world of computers and their technology it seems.
						I have the coolest MySpace known to man on the internet. With my two trades behind me which tied closely to IT with automation and Tv/ Data installs,
						I finally feel I am in the right time in my life to start studying something I love and most importantly to finish what I started many moons ago.
						Who wouldn’t want to study completely online through a reputable IT university in Melbourne. </p><br>
					
					<p><i> Myer-Briggs Test- Logistician </i><br></p>
						<p> The results that I got were that my results are thought to be the most abundant making up around 13% of the population. 
						Logisticians are thought to be vital to many families as well as organisations that uphold traditions, rules and standards. 
						When working towards goals Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy completing each task with accuracy and patience.  </p><br>
			
					<p><i>Big Five Personality Test – Pragmatist </i><br></p>
						<p>I need to see how learning is applied into practice in the real world.
						I am concerned with matters of fact than with what could or should be. 
						I like to try out new theories and experiment to see if things work or not. I learn best with practicals, case studies, problem settings and discussions.  </p><br>
						
						
					<p><i>Learning Styles Test – EMTRAIN WP8   </i><br></p>
						<p> My main learning style in Pragmatist followed by Reflector, Theorist and Activist.
						Matching so well with Pragmatist I am concerned with matter of fact and not what could or should be. 
						I also like to stand back and observe to a certain extent. 
						I am slightly cautious but I also like to collect and analyse information presented to me.
						I think of problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity. I aim to fit things into a rational order. 
						I do tend to immerser myself into new experiences  and I enjoy the here and now. I tend to be open minded enthusiastic and flexible.
						I see myself and extremely introverted in which I find it hard to interact with others a little hard at times. 
						None of my traits I believe will not weigh heavily when working a group or team environment. 
						I do tend to get a tad grumpy with people who do not pull their weight and contribute in a team.
						This, I need to consider and I would consider this to be a downfall of mine and I have to remember that I am not the only one working in a team, I have to remember to share the load. </p><br>

				<h3> Student number: s3933582    </h3>
					<p> I am a Brisbane born mum of two teenage children. I currently work in the health sector and would like to continue my IT path from many years ago,
						somehow a good life got in the way. My interest in IT was sparked whilst at school, my teacher was my inspiration just as the world wide web become known to humans.
						Boy has technology come far; my imagination was filled with endless possibilities. 
						I am not sure what my exact interest in IT is, but I have worked with 3D graphics before and enjoyed this immensely. 
					I do not have a background in IT apart from using my mobile phone on a daily basis but would like to pursue something different other than health care given this crazy covid world in which we live.  </p><br>
					
				<p><i> Myer-Briggs Test- The Consul </i><br></p>
					<p> Whilst I am known in my test results as the caregiver, I tend to be extroverted rather than introverted, loyal and organised.
						Whilst I enjoy working independently, I enjoy working with others and gain energy out of doing so. I enjoy helping others and can be sensitive to others needs.
					I do like to have control over my environment and like to feel in command. </p><br>
					
				<p><i>Big Five Personality Test</i><br></p>
					At times I can be creative, curious, and adventurous and then other times I feel I need routine. 
					I am generally a good problem solver in which I consider the tried-and-true method, but I also like to think outside the box.
					I tend to be a social butterfly and love meeting new people and building relationships with others. 
					I tend to speak more than I listen but always seem calm and level-headed. My mood can fluctuate depending on the day, sorry group. 
					I tend to look on the brighter side of life and even though my mood can fluctuate I try and give out a vibrant personality. 
					I do my best at everything I do even if there is nothing in it for me. 
					I listen to people when and where needed and help in the best way I know how can usually offer helpful suggestions in solving a problem.
					I am a visual learner not so textbook based. I generally follow direction well given a task; I am not a group leader.
					I must learn to give myself more credit where credit is due. I have a bad habit of not liking to work in groups and prefer to work alone,
					this is something that I will learn to overcome as I get happiness from helping other people. I am not a good leader I am a follower generally speaking. </p><br>
					
				<p><i>Learning Styles Test –  Strong Tactile Learner  </i><br></p>
					<p> I remember things best once I have gained experience in them and do best by being out of my chair and giving things ago in a practical sense. 
						I don’t understand things if just read them. Reading bores me. I talk a lot with my hands and have been known to be a fidgety student because usually sitting too long drives me nuts.  </p><br>
