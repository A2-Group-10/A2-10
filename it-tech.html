			<h1><u>Cyber Security</u></h1> <br>
				
			<h3><i> What does it do?</i></h3><br><br> <p>Cyber Security protects computers or computer systems from cyber-attacks such as unwarranted access of information or data breeches. 
				These measures can be put in place to protect the computers and their users. Malware spy ware or data breeches are just some of the unwarranted attacks or access gained to computers and their users.  
				The Merriam–Webster dictionary defines cyber security as “measures taken to protect a computer or computer system (as on the Internet) against unauthorized access or attack” (Merriam-Webster, 2020). </p><br>
				
			<h3><i>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </i></h3><br><br>  <p>As summarised by agencies in the US many government
					agencies have reported a rise in cyber attacks not just with computers and their users but also in electrical grids. (NCCIC, 2018).
					When comparing the signatures and intrusion events that are identified as the network traffic matches the same pattern in a pre-defined database,
				there is a strong set of rules that should be adhered to. (NCCIC, 2018) </p><br><br>
		
		
		<h3><i>What can be done now?</h3> </i><br><br><p> Below are a few things that one could do using this. allows us to secure our network or system, which has to work with critical or sensitive organizational data. <br><br>
			<i>Data protection</i> –The primary role of Cybersecurity is to protect the confidential data that is supposed to be accessed by the authorized user only. <br><br>

			<i>Enforcing CIA</i> – The three features of Cybersecurity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, could be enforced by the mean of internet security. <br><br>

			<i>Mitigate breach</i> risk –The very secure and updated system is very less biased towards security breaches. It helps the users to protect their data from getting exposed to any of malicious user or attacker. <br><br>

			<i>Ensures business continuity</i> –It offers some plan that ensures sustainable business processes, which could keep the organization’s reputation and ensure that business should continue without any obstacle. <br><br></p>
			
			<h3><i> What is likely to be able to do be done soon, say in next 3 years?</i></h3><br><br>
			<p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer and not just being used by robots to carry out household tasks and mundane tasks for us, like mowing the grass or vacuuming the floor. (Goddard, 2021) 
				Artificial intelligences are being increasingly and undoubtedly used by both cyber criminals and cybersecurity teams. 
				In the future of cybersecurity Artificial Intelligence will one day play a very big part in cyber security.(Goddard, 2021) The number and variety of cyber threats will continue to increase year-on-year.
				Here are some examples are: - Organised gangs, untrusted internet, State sponsored attacks, phishing attacks. 
				With the implementation of strong defences against cyber-attack, this will  require access to a skilled, experienced cybersecurity workforce. 
				This will increasingly become a challenge. The demand for staff with well-developed cybersecurity skills is growing much faster than the supply. 
				(Goddard, 2021) Research conducted in 2020 highlighted that the number of unfilled cybersecurity vacancies could increase from 1 million in 2014 to 3.5 million in 2021. 
				Unless there are enough people with the skills to counter the growing number of cyber threats, the harm to everybody will increase.(Goddard, 2021).</p><br>
			
			<h3><i>What technological or other developments make this possible? </i></h3><br><br> <p> Cars and trucks and vehicles of today are full of digital devices,
					including sensors, GPS tracking systems, audio systems, and control systems. 
					Many digital devices are now connected to the internet, equipped with Bluetooth capability to link with other devices.
					(Goddard, 2021)  Vehicles are becoming an increasingly attractive and lucrative target for cyber criminals. 
					(Goddard, 2021) This will get even worse as self-driving cars are made available. Today’s modern homes use Internet of Things (IoT) devices to make our lives easier. 
					(Goddard, 2021) Voice-activated doors, windows, and home alarm systems are now commonplace. (Goddard, 2021)  </p><br>
			
			
			
			<h3><i>What is the likely Impact?  </i></h3><br><br> <p>Peoples lives and the easy access to data from the criminals is likely to impact everyone that has some sort of technology present within their home or mobile.
					Due in part to the lack of effective IT security adoption by the thousands of device manufacturers and service providers, hackers are now adept at hacking into these devices, 
					which then gives them easy access to the connected private networks. (Goddard, 2021).  For example, a criminal could detect that everybody in the household had gone out in the car, 
					leaving the home empty and vulnerable to a burglary attack. (Goddard, 2021) Attackers will also be able to target the vehicles themselves,
					potentially using them to access email accounts and personal information or the cloud services where the data is routinely sent for storage and analysis.
			(Goddard, 2021)</p><br> <br><h3><i>What is the potential impact of this development?</i></h3><br><br>  <p> The potential impact will be catastrophic to people who don’t have excellent cyber security.
					Their data and security could potentially be sold to cyber hackers and criminals to feed their ongoing cyber habits.  </p>
			<br><br><h3><i>What is likely to change?</i></h3><br><br><p> Cyber criminals are likely to get smarter as technology does.
					Things that the average Joe hasn’t even dared to dream of yet. </p>
					 <br> <br> <h3><i> The way we use technology is likely to change. Which people will be most affected and how? </i></h3><br><br>
					<p>Everyone will be affected as long as there is data and lack of cyber security, the criminals and hackers will still be able to keep their crimes going.</p>  
			<br><br><h3><i>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </i></h3><br><br>
					<p>If anything, I think that this will create current jobs as technology gets smarter and data and the internet are still evolving.<br> <br>
			<h3><i>How will this affect you?</i></h3><br>  <br>
					<p>This will affect me in my everyday life as I use technology for work and at home daily. As a user of technology, 
					I will have to be up to date with the increasing possibility of cyber-attacks and the use of home and cyber security within my social and local environment.</p>
			<br><br><h3><i>What will be different for you?</i></h3><br><br>
					<p>With the knowledge of cyber security and home security. 
					How all the new technologies all link together. I will have to be tech savvy and know about how cyber criminals will use my data and my devices to hack and steal personal data and information from now on and into the future.  
					This will affect my family members on a personal level. Especially the younger generation as technologies are only advancing and growing daily. 
					Cyber criminals are becoming smarter by working smarter not harder. I will have to make my family and friends aware of the technologies and the way criminals are misusing personal data in cyber-attacks. </p><br>

			<h1><i><u>2. Cloud, Services and Servers </u></i></h1><br>
				<h3><i> What does it do?</i></h3><br><br>
 				<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of services and applications to end users using someone else’s (the cloud provider’s) computers.
					Originally intended to provide businesses with a way to outsource their server hardware
					that traditionally needed to be purchased and maintained, cloud services have expanded over 
					the years from virtual machine-based hardware alternatives to a range of services that help reduce
					more of the effort required from customer IT departments in keeping the business IT infrastructure running. 
					Cloud services are typically provided as operational expenditure “as-a-Service” offerings, with three traditional core categories.
					(Accenture, 2021) </p><br><br>
				
				<h3><i>1. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</i></h3><br>
					<p>One of the first cloud services to be offered,
						IaaS services provide customers with the capability to run their workloads in the cloud on virtual machines as an alternative
						to hardware on the customer’s premises. Services offered that are considered Infrastructure-as-a-Service include virtual machines,
						“bare metal” servers and data storage. The cloud provider is responsible for providing and maintaining the server and network hardware,
						environments and security that the provided services run on, while the customer is responsible for maintaining the software environments
						within the virtual machines or bare metal servers, comprising of the operating system (such as Windows or Linux) and the applications
						running within it. Customers may select IaaS cloud services where there is a desire to outsource the provisioning of hardware that would
						normally need to be purchased and installed on-premises and/or to convert the large capital expenditure of a hardware refresh or purchase
						into an operational expense in the form of an ongoing service fee. The reduction in support costs as the cloud provider becomes responsible
						for the maintenance and refresh of the hardware is also a common consideration. Examples of IaaS cloud providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS),
						Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. </p><br><br>
				
				<h3><i>2. Software-as-a-service (SaaS)</i></h3><br>
					<p>The next most common cloud service available are applications provided as Software-as-a-Service. 
						Applications fully hosted by the cloud provider. All infrastructure and software environments
						are the responsibility of the cloud provider to maintain, upgrade and secure. Benefits to the
						customers are that nearly all support costs are shifted to the operational expenditure of the 
						recurring service cost, making these costs a predictable element. Rather than managing the operating 
						system and applications, including upgrading software versions and security patching, customers instead
						focus on configuration specific to their organisation. SaaS applications are typically delivered to customers
						through a web page based interface, with some SaaS applications also including downloadable software components.
						Examples include Microsoft Office 365 (delivered through both web and downloadable software clients) and Canvas (delivered via web). </p><br><br>
				
			<h3><i>3. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</i></h3>
					<p>Platform-as-a-Service is a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, and provides specific subsystems to customers that need
						to run applications themselves (because their application isn’t available in SaaS form) but would like to outsource
						as much as possible. Examples of PaaS offerings include data warehouses, where the cloud provider provides the server
						and storage hardware and manages the database software upgrading and patching while the customer manages the database
						structure and data, and enterprise integration platforms (used for translating Application Programming Interface (API)
						calls between different systems) where the cloud provider provides the server hardware and associated environments and
						the customer is responsible for development of the API translation modules specific to each software system. Examples
						include Microsoft Azure SQL Database and Microsoft Azure Integration Services. </p> <br><br>
				
				<h3><i> What is likely to be done soon (say the next 3 years)?</i></h3><br><br>
					
						<p>The demand for cloud services (a viable option for remote work) is ever increasing since the pandemic's existence 
							has allowed business growth and explosive development of SaaS providers and services.  Users will continue
							to rely heavily on cloud services into the future (including streaming services and developing cloud dependant services)
							. According to Gartner, SaaS will continue to be the leading cloud segment of the market by revenue in 2021
							, expanding to $117.7 billion by the end of the year. (Chowdry, M, 2021)  “Cloud is no longer a future aspiration,
							it’s an urgent mandate. Cloud is not only essential to successful digital transformation, but the global disruption
							wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic has reemphasized the fundamental value of systems resilience, agility, adaptability
							and scalability.” (Accenture, 2021) Within the next three years I expect that businesses may shift to implementing
							hybrid and multi cloud strategies following 87 per cent of business in 2021.  Business will continue to do this
							preventing them being dependant on a single provider, which will becoming increasingly easier as more providers
							emerge soon to meet and facilitate the rising demand.  Chowdhury, 2021)  </p><br><br>

 			
			 
		
					<h3><i> What is the likely impact?</i></h3> <br><br>
					
						<p>An increase in the availability of Cloud services, infrastructure and software will allow for faster, more efficient
							and resilient IT systems for both business and personal users. This innovation will rely on enterprise realising
							the significant cost savings in development of new architecture and infrastructure provisions (Iaas), Platform
							Services (PaaS) and Software (SaaS).  For end users this will mean they can leverage the benefits of Clous-native
							innovations immediately. (Accenture, 2001) There is also evidence that there will be significant financial growth
							in Enterprise clous investments in both public and private sectors as investments have climbed 34.4 per cent ove
							r the last year (IDC 2021) while non cloud spending fell by 8% (Chowdhury, 2021).  This indicates that the interest
							and the need for expansion and investment into these resources are both of interest and financial benefit dictating
							their continued growth. <br> Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? As cloud
							systems are integrated into business and enterprise there is a significant potential that there will be a reduction
							in the number of IT support staff required to be retained by companies as there will be less hardware installed
							on premises that needs to manage and maintained by inhouse IT systems management. With the increasing
							development and management of Cloud services will dictate the areas of IT that would require IT professionals
							to specialise. With a higher redundancy of IT support staff, it would indicate that special interest in growth
							areas such as cloud development would be recommended. <br>  Although there will be a reduction in jobs available
							for those in IT support there will however be a need for training and equipping enough talented support for
							clients using the digital cloud environments. (Chowdhury, 2021) </p><br><br>
					
					<h3><i> How will this affect you? </i></h3> <br><br>
						<p>With an Apple based environment at home we rely on iCloud to securely store photos, files, passwords, and data
							so that there is a seamless and up-to-date access automatically on all devices. It also makes transition
							between devices seamless when editing and writing documents. A simple copy on one device is available for
							paste immediately on another. It means far improved productivity in the home/work environment. (Apple, 2021)
							Cloud services (such as the iCloud that is available to me through our apple ecosystem) are already readily
							available to the home user in ways that are continually being modified to be more user-friendly and accessible.
							Leading platforms of Cloud environments including Amazon Web Services (AWS) Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud
							will continue to dominate the market for both professional and home users.  Ultimately this means that those
							not in the IT industry (such as friends and family) will not need to purchase and maintain expensive hardware
							at home, rather accessing the services they need for storage and data protection over Cloud. 
							The availability and increasing convenience and quality of Cloud environments will mean that
							working from home will continue to develop into a more productive space than ever before.
							Since the pandemic it has become Increasingly evident that a productive cloud environment
							is critical to sustain and grow business and enterprise, a fact that will be a factor in
							my work life as I enter the IT industry.  </p><br><br>
