			<h1>Project Idea</h1> <br> <br>
			<h3><u> Overview </u> </h3> <br><br>

				<p> With an ever-increasing popularity and demand for independent craft style breweries
					in Australia Creative Protocol proposes to develop an application for mobile devices
					that will allow easy and efficient map and information access to explore local listed breweries.
					The App would be designed to work on iOS and Android devices and would also include website application capabilities.
					The Application would rely on GPS technology to gather and pin information, allow radius access to local
					breweries and venues and to search for specific breweries.  A review rating system, push notifications,
					digital calendar for logging and tracking events and simple feedback system will be incorporated to increase
					user interface engagement. We will be filling a market gap for those who are time poor and want efficient triangulated
					access to their local beer creators. See below our vision for what the app user-interface is going to look like </p><br><br>



			<h3> Motivation </h3><br><br>

				<p> There have been significant increases in the number of Independent Breweries within Australia
					(99 in New South Wales out of 294 nationally) (Statista Nov. 2020), resulting in a lack of
					consolidated brewery information, reviews, and pinned locations available for easy reference
					by craft beer connoisseurs.  Also, there has been a significant market shift in recent years
					with increasing number of micro-pub style breweries being created due to lack of shelf space
					in major retailers, (Sutton, 2021). Creative Protocol propose to create a mobile phone application
					and website that will help customers discover new breweries and their products, and plan for any trips
					to the cellar door using our brewery catalogue. Seasonal and special craft beers with limited runs that
					are often easily missed by patrons not keeping a keen eye on their favourite Master Brewers will be better
					advertised through the app and website being a single consolidated and trusted source, with push notifications
					matching customer interests. Customers and brewers will be able to create accounts and upload information to a
					database that can include customer reviews, crowd-sourced information, and official brewery data such as available
					products, special or seasonal runs, events, and dining options. Current market analysis indicates that there is
					a gap in the market for a tool with the level of functionality included, with an existing website
					(with no associated mobile app) identified without key proposed features included. </p><br><br>

			<h3> Features </h3><br><br>

				<p> 	We will implement a map style feature that is going to use GPS technology to gather the information on your
					location and pin surrounding venues to give the user a clean and easy way to see where they are in relation
					to said venues, or swipe around freely to explore any areas. A search bar is to be included also if you would
					like to search for a specific favourite brewery or a favourite beer. <br><br>
					We aim to include a user rating system, users should be able to see clearly which beers or which breweries
					other users enjoyed too, and then recommendations can be given when the ratings you have given personally
					can be compared to other users who have enjoyed similar things. A 0–5-star rating attached to each product
					and venue is how we wish to achieve this, and a section where a user can write a comment further explaining
					why they have chosen to give the rating they did. There is also to be an events page, a digital calendar
					where any upcoming events/special brews can be added into. <br><br>
					Push notifications are another feature to be included, if people are looking for a specific drop, they
					need to be made aware of when this is available to them as soon as possible. For example, if they have
					visited a brewery before and given a high rating, they will be notified of any events that are happening
					at that brewery from the information stored in the events calendar. The same thing applies if they liked
					a particular beer, they could see what brewers offer the same or similar products. <br><br>
					The user interface is another area of paramount importance, the UI needs to be attractive and easy to
					navigate for users all of ages and technological prowess. To achieve this we will use clean, bright,
					and bold colours whilst also utilizing large buttons to help guide the user through menus in a way
					that they can clearly understand what to do and which buttons to press. A quick guide showing new
					users through the features of the app is also to be implemented. With the number of different
					smartphones on the market currently, the app also needs to be adaptable to different screen sizes,
					plus have a working website version. <br><br>
					We want to understand our users’ experiences within the app, we will achieve this with a simple
					feedback system which will be a text box in which you can report a bug, give ideas on new features,
					or just give general feedback whether it be positive or negative. Testing will also be conducted prio
					r to release on friends/family to ensure the application is in a good position beforehand. </p><br><br>


			<h3>Tools</h3><br><br>

				<p>	 We intend to use open-source software. As stated, we want to develop a clean looking application
					that is supported on multiple platforms, some open-source tools that we can use to create
					 all the features we could use include: <br><br><i>Development environments</i><br>

				 	-Computer supporting app development for target platforms (Mac is common to Apple and Android)<br>
				 	-Development tools (such as compilers) and intergrated Development Environments for the target platforms, such
						 as AWS Amplify Studio, Xcode and Android Studio

				 <br><br>
				 	<i>Hardware for target platforms to test app use and performance on</i>
				 	<br>

				 	-Apple iPhones and iPads of varying models (if available)<br>
				 	-Android phones of varying models (if available)

				 <br><br>
				 	<i>Collaboration tools between developers </i><br>

				 	-Git repository to maintain a version source code and enable mulitple developers to write the source code if required
				 	-Communication tools for collaboration between team members, espicially if working remotely, such as microsoft teams.
				 <br><br>
				 	Within the app users will mainly need to search for stored information, receive push notifications
				 	and collect statistical data about other users. AWS Amplify is a standout cloud-based platform that
				 	is going to meet all the requirements of our application through its Library component,
				 	here we can store information, collect analytics, send push notifications, and add
				 	multiple other features to our application on the back end. Being a cloud-based service, it is also
				 	scalable which is going to become important should the app be successful. More information can be found on their website.  </p><br><br>


				 <h3>Skills required </h3><br><br>
				 	<p>
				 		-Development skills in Swift for IOS app development and in C/C++ or Java for Android App development. <br>
				 		-User interface design skills will need to be developed and coding skills further explored.
				 			Also, a peer review of the software design would facilitate the development of the prospective app. <br>
				 		-Project management skills would be highly necessary to keep the design and implementation of the app on track.

				 </p><br><br>


				 <h3> What potential obstacles or drawbacks can we anticipate </h3> <br><br>
				 	<p> There are other apps and websites available that offer similar user information;
				 	however, we are aiming to provide our users a point of difference.  These competitor applications
				 are lacking the depth of scope we are trying to provide our users, lacking several important and sought-after
				 features, and easy to navigate user experience. One of our biggest competitors is Crafty Pint. Originally an
				 online magazine, they have managed to acquire breweries to sign up through the popularity of their website.
				 We intend to use a combination of methods to populate the app with brewery information, accessing backing
				 from IBA and populating from their established database, using data that is publicly available and
				 then reaching out to the individual breweries and request more specific information like what drinks
				 they have on tap, upcoming events, and upcoming specialty releases. We intend to offer user submitted
				 reviews of the beers available at each brewery and build individual profiles of users based off the
				 ratings they give that can be used to recommend breweries and specific brews that users with a similar
				 profile also rated highly. The outcome is intended to be similar to the way Spotify recommends music
				 based off other users with similar taste. Our competitors also do not offer any option to search for specific
				 brews, only to search breweries and then view the catalogue. We believe this is a fundamental flaw in our
				 competitors apps due to the belief that users not only want to visit different breweries but may also want
				 to search for a particular brew and find out where it is available. <br><br> We intend to provide incentive for
				 breweries to deliver information to us when it is relevant by publishing content that attracts users to
				 the app. The content will include at home craft brewing tips, articles written about newly released brews
				 and upcoming breweries. If user’s sign-up to gain access to brewery and brew related content, breweries
				 themselves will have a reason to provide us with the data we require. Revenue for the craft brewery
				 industry declined 6.9% from 2019 -2020 as major brewers are more readily available through chain
				 retailers (IBIS World, 2021). However, moving forward as society enters a new "normal" the industry
				is expected to increase over the next two years. This could indicate that the development of our
				proposal is timely and beneficial which would bring support and backing from local brewers as it will assist
				 in keeping smaller operators with more foot traffic and therefore in business. <br>
				 Due to the nature of the application that we are proposing to develop there would need to be age
				 restrictions enabled on Application download. As our target market of users would fall into an older age bracket,
				we do not feel this will limit the scope of our product success. Examining the median age of populations in major
				cities and regions within Australia, the median age of consumers in capital cities is 36.5 years or
				regionally 41.4 years (ABS, 2020). This is fitting within our expected market of 20–49-year old’s
				making up 44% of the Australian Population (ABS, 2020). This would align with the style of product we are proposing
				to develop, tailored to the increasing demand for master crafted brews, local independent producers, and the support
				local initiative. Now is the time to produce and rollout a functional and in demand application as we are proposing to develop.
				To fund the project, we propose to involve the Independent Brewers Association (IBA) and rely on their information pathways to
				fill the relevant information categories in the app. Involving an organisation such as IBA we would be adding a degree of self-sufficiency
				to the application while continuing to bring revenue through advertising that will fund the maintenance and continued efficacy of the end product.
				The drawback of this method would rely on IBA to keep their database and information up to date but would add the benefit of adding continued regular
				updates of any registered indie and craft brewers and their custom special products.  We would require a test user environment to examine the efficacy
				  of the app and give feedback for further future development. </p> <br><br>







		<h3> Development and Innovation </h3> <br><br>

				<p> For the application to be successful we will need to possess or outsource various skills.
				Cloud infrastructure is going to be an important part of our development, it is a necessity that within our team
				there is a good understanding of this technology (in this case AWS cloud services). Popular modern coding languages
				are also going to be required, Java, JavaScript and Swift (for Apple iOS) are notably the three necessary candidates for
				a cross platform mobile app. This expertise is around in abundance, and we believe it to be feasible to obtain these skills
				should we not possess them within our team. One of the main moving parts is going to be the database, we will make this easier
				by employing the use of DynamoDB, an automatic scaling database should the app be successful. <br><br> The App is designed with an easy-to-use UI.
				This allows users to select brewing styles on their map through the drop-down menu on and also allow
				free scrolling to different areas or hit the GPS location button on the right to take them back to their location
				(see Figure 1-Initial Proposed Application Design). Upon finding an area, users can click on the icon and see the name and
				rating of a location and tap again to open to see menus, reviews, and events. There is also an easy to access taskbar, found on
				the top left, this provides more menu items such as a wish list for brews you would like to try or buy, events tab for any events
				that may be currently happening. This menu will also include a Feedback and Help section) so should any part of
				the application not be satisfactory; they can let us know and we can implement changes accordingly.
				We believe the structure behind this app will be easily transferred into similar projects like a version for coffee shops,
				wineries, and gin distilleries.   </p><br><br>

		<h3> Outcome and Feasibility </h3>
			<p> From the outset Creative Protocol were able to see the need for an app that meets our proposed specifications.
				We have assessed the market, analysed our competition and incorporated the key features that users require
				to create an app that will not only be able to efficiently meet customer expectation we have also identified
				growth opportunities for the future where we can repurpose the code to launch as a unique app (for coffee lovers)
				so that people who are not interested in micro brewers become another market base, more income and no more labour for our team.
				Feasibility analysis of our project consisted of several parts: <br>

				<i>Is there a demand?</i><br>
				<i>Is our solution suitable and reasonable?</i><br>
				<i>Are we capable of carrying the proposal through to completion?</i><br>
			<br>
				On assessment of these aspects, we were able to determine that indeed our project proposal is feasible and desirable.
				With an oversaturation of craft breweries and lack of shelf space in market retailers there is a shift in the industry
				to micro-pub breweries that sell directly to customers via a “cellar door” system and may including dining options.
				A catalogue app like the one we are offering is highly desirable, and a reasonable solution to the demand that is being
				seen in the changing dynamic of microbrewery-pub operators.  Our proposed product would increase visibility and traffic
				to these sites making it a valuable addition to the marketplace.  As we have established the existence of web-based and
				low scope alternatives to the product we are planning to create it is evident that we can carry the proposed app to fruition.
				To engage full functionality of our App we will need to invest time developing key skill factors and potentially involving
				skilled contractors. However, it is possible, it is doable and therefore it is feasible that our App proposal can become a useful reality.</p>
