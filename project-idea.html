			<h1>Project Idea</h1> <br> <br>
			<h3><u> Overview </u> </h3> <br><br>
				
				<p> With an ever-increasing popularity and demand for independent craft style breweries
					in Australia Creative Protocol proposes to develop an application for mobile devices
					that will allow easy and efficient map and information access to explore local listed breweries.
					The App would be designed to work on iOS and Android devices and would also include website application capabilities. 
					The Application would rely on GPS technology to gather and pin information, allow radius access to local
					breweries and venues and to search for specific breweries.  A review rating system, push notifications,
					digital calendar for logging and tracking events and simple feedback system will be incorporated to increase
					user interface engagement. We will be filling a market gap for those who are time poor and want efficient triangulated 
					access to their local beer creators. </p><br><br>
			
			<h3> Motivation </h3>
			
				<p> There have been significant increases in the number of Independent Breweries within Australia
					(99 in New South Wales out of 294 nationally) (Statista Nov. 2020), resulting in a lack of 
					consolidated brewery information, reviews, and pinned locations available for easy reference 
					by craft beer connoisseurs.  Also, there has been a significant market shift in recent years
					with increasing number of micro-pub style breweries being created due to lack of shelf space
					in major retailers, (Sutton, 2021). Creative Protocol propose to create a mobile phone application
					and website that will help customers discover new breweries and their products, and plan for any trips
					to the cellar door using our brewery catalogue. Seasonal and special craft beers with limited runs that 
					are often easily missed by patrons not keeping a keen eye on their favourite Master Brewers will be better
					advertised through the app and website being a single consolidated and trusted source, with push notifications
					matching customer interests. Customers and brewers will be able to create accounts and upload information to a
					database that can include customer reviews, crowd-sourced information, and official brewery data such as available
					products, special or seasonal runs, events, and dining options. Current market analysis indicates that there is
					a gap in the market for a tool with the level of functionality included, with an existing website
					(with no associated mobile app) identified without key proposed features included. </p>
